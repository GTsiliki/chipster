TOOL "HMM" / hmmemit.sadl: hmmemit (Sample sequences from a profile HMM)
INPUT hmm-model.txt: "HMM model" TYPE GENERIC
OUTPUT hmmemit.txt
PARAMETER OPTIONAL N: "Number of sequences to sample" TYPE INTEGER FROM 1 (Sample several sequences, rather than just one.)
PARAMETER OPTIONAL consensus-value-only: "emit simple consensus sequence" TYPE [NO-VALUE: "No", -c: "Yes"] DEFAULT NO-VALUE (Emit a consensus sequence, instead of sampling a sequence from HMM's probability distribution. The consensus sequence is formed by selecting the maximum probability residue at each match state. 

Please note that if this is set to 'Yes', the 'Number of sequences to sample' must be empty.)
