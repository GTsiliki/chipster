PARAMETER operator: "The logical operator to combine the sequences" TYPE [O: "OR - merger of both sets", A: "AND - only those in both sets", X: "XOR - only those not in both sets", N: "NOT - those of the first set that are not in the second"] DEFAULT O (The following logical operators combine the sequences in the following ways: \ OR - gives all that occur in one set or the other \ AND - gives only those which occur in both sets \ XOR - gives those which only occur in one set or the other, but not in both \ NOT - gives those which occur in the first set except for those that also occur in the second)
