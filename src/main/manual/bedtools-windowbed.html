<h2>BEDTools windowBed</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Examines a "window" around each feature in A and reports all features in B that overlap the window. For each overlap the entire entry in A and B are reported.
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>The A input file is in BAM format (yes, no) [no]</li>
<li>Write uncompressed BAM output (yes, no) [no]</li>
<li>When using BAM input, write output as BED (yes, no) [no]</li>
<li>Base pairs added upstream (Integer) [1000]</li> 
<li>Base pairs added downstream (Integer) [1000]</li> 
<li>Define window based on strand (yes, no) [no]</li>
<li>Only report hits in B that overlap A on the same strand (yes, no) [no]</li>
<li>Write the original A entry once if any overlaps found in B (yes, no) [no]</li>
<li>For each entry in A, report the number of overlaps with B (yes, no) [no]</li>
<li>Only report those entries in A that have no overlaps with B (yes, no) [no]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
Similar to intersectBed, windowBed searches for overlapping features in A and B. However,
windowBed adds a specified number (1000, by default) of base pairs upstream and downstream of
each feature in A. In effect, this allows features in B that are “near” features in A to be detected.
</p>
<p>
Selecting "File A is BAM format [yes]" is analogous to using "-abam" option instead of "-a" in the command line version.
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
Default output is a BED file. If input is a BAM file, output can also be a compressed or uncompressed BAM file depending on the options selected.
