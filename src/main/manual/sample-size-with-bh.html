	<h2>Statistics / Sample size calculations with an adapted BH method</h2>
	
	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>Perform sample size calculations using an adapted Benjamini-Hochberg method.</p>
	
	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Phenodata column separating the samples into two groups</li>
		<li>Assume equal variances between groups (yes, no) [no]</li>
		<li>Distribution to calculate p-values from (normal, student) [normal]</li>
		<li>False discovery rate (0-1) [0.1]</li>
		<li>Image width (200...3200) [600]</li>
		<li>Image height (200...3200) [600]</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Details</h3>
	<p>This tool uses an adapted version of the Benjamini-Hochberg method to perform sample size calculations using a pilot data set. The necessary parameters, such as effect size and the proportion of differentially expressed genes, are estimated from the data. For more details, please see the referenced articles.</p>
	
	<h3>Output</h3>
	<p>A plot and a text table showing estimates of average power as a function of sample size.</p>
	<p>A set of quality control plots. For interpretation, please see the referenced CGHpower paper, and these <a href="http://www.cangem.org/cghpower/datasets/">evaluation data sets</a>.</p>
