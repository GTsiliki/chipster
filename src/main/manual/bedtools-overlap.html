<h2>BEDTools overlap</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Computes the amount of overlap (positive values) or distance (negative values) between genome features and reports the result at the end of the same line.
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Columns to use (Integer, Integer, Integer, Integer) [2,3,6,7]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
overlap computes the amount of overlap (in the case of positive values) or distance (in the case of
negative values) between feature coordinates occurring on the same input line and reports the result at
the end of the same line. In this way, it is a useful method for computing custom overlap scores from
the output of other BEDTools.

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
The output is a tab-delimited text file.
