<h2>Matching genomic regions / Closest BED</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
For each feature in A, finds the closest feature (upstream or downstream) in B.
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Force strandedness (yes, no) [no]</li>
<li>Report distance (yes, no) [no]</li> 
<li>Approach to reporting multiple overlaps (all, first, last) [all]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
Similar to intersectBed, closestBed searches for overlapping features in A and B. In the event that
no feature in B overlaps the current feature in A, closestBed will report the closest (that is, least
genomic distance from the start or end of A) feature in B. For example, one might want to find which
is the closest gene to a significant GWAS polymorphism. Note that closestBed will report an
overlapping feature as the closest, that is, it does not restrict to closest non-overlapping feature.
