<h2>Guide for Integrating Analysis Scripts into Chipster</h2>

<p>Basically, you have to do three things:</p>
<ul>
   <li>provide the R script</li>
   <li>write a description, so that the script can be run and shown in the client application</li>
	<ul>
           <li>check also its validity</li>
	</ul>
   <li>make analyser aware of the script </li>
</ul>



<h3>Making R-scripts Chipster-compatible</h3>

<p>Chipster uses regular R-scripts. The only thing to remember is that interactive functions can not be used.</p>

<p>Before running the script, the system runs the following initialisation snippet:</p>

<pre>
setwd(".")
</pre>

<p>The script should output results in table format to a file specified in description header. So, for example like this:</p>

<pre>
write.table(mytable, file="results.txt", quote=FALSE, col.names=FALSE, row.names=FALSE)
</pre>

<h3>Writing VVSADL-description</h3>

<p>R-scripts must be described by using a Chipster-specific description format called VVSADL (Very Very Simple Analysis Description 
Language). A VVSADL-snippet is added in comments as a header to a R-script file. The specification for 
the VVSADL can be found from the Javadoc documentation of the class fi.csc.microarray.VVSADLSyntax. Reasonably 
up-to-date copy of the document should be available from http://ocicat.csc.fi/microarray/javadocs/fi/csc/microarray/VVSADLSyntax.html.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a VVSADL snippet to attach before of the actual R code:</p>

<pre>
# ANALYSIS Test/test (Just a test analysis for development)
# INPUT CDNA microarray[...].txt OUTPUT results.txt, messages.txt
# PARAMETER value1 INTEGER FROM 0 TO 200 DEFAULT 10 (the first value of the result set)
# PARAMETER value2 DECIMAL FROM 0 TO 200 DEFAULT 20 (the second value of the result set)
# PARAMETER value3 DECIMAL FROM 0 TO 200 DEFAULT 30.2 (the third value of the result set)
# PARAMETER method PERCENT DEFAULT 34 (how much we need)
# PARAMETER method [linear, logarithmic, exponential] DEFAULT logarithmic (which method to apply)
# PARAMETER genename STRING DEFAULT at_something (which gene we are interested in)
# PARAMETER key COLNAME (which column we use as a key)
</pre>

<p>The analysis function named "test" is added to category "Test". Multiword names must be put into quotation 
marks. It has a description "Just a test analysis for development". It takes a set of input files called microarray0.txt, 
microarray1.txt etc. in cDNA-format (tab separated values), so the script can assume that the files exist in the 
working directory when it is called by the analyser. It outputs results to a file "results.txt" and execution related extra 
information to a file "messages.txt". The analyser assumes that the files exist after the script is run.</p>

<p>Then we have to define parameters. They are made available by the analyser as variables. So, for example, the script 
can assume to have an integer variable called value1 with a value in between of 0 and 200. Parameters must be given 
a name and a type, can be given a range and a default value, and must be given a description (in quotation marks).</p>

<p>Everything should be in the same order is in the example snippet. So, for example, parameters have to be described 
after input/output. Only the first line (ANALYSIS) is compulsory.</p>

<h3>VVSADL Details</h3>

<h4>Input/output types:</h4>

<pre>
    * CDNA
          o result of a cDNA scan
          o must not have a header
          o columns CH1I_MEAN, CH1B_MEDIAN, CH2I_MEAN, CH2B_MEDIAN 
    * AFFY
          o result of a Affy scan
          o must have a header
          o columns X, Y, MEAN, STDV, NPIXELS 
    * EXPRS
          o expression values, calculated from scan results
          o must not have a header
          o column EXPR 
    * GENE_EXPRS
          o expression values with associated probeset names
          o must not have a header
          o for Affy data, but this could be used for cDNA data also?
          o columns PROBESET_ID, EXPR 
    * GENENAMES
          o probeset names
          o column PROBESET_ID 
</pre>

<p>Often (note: this should be specified) column names can be derived automatically, so they are not needed. This is 
the case with analysis script result files.</p>

<h4>Parameter types:</h4>

<pre>
    * INTEGER
          o integer value 
    * DECIMAL
          o decimal value 
    * PERCENT
          o integer from between 0 - 100
          o might be removed in future, if there is no need for this 
    * STRING
          o a free string value 
    * [val1, val2, val3]
          o enumeration type
          o possible values are given in block parenthesis 
    * COLNAME
          o a column name present in the input matrix
                + in case of multiple inputs, present in all of them 
          o can also be empty 
</pre>


<h3>Validating Annotated R-Scripts</h3>

<p>A validator is provided in the Chipster-distribution. You can trigger it with command line parameter rcheck, followed 
with script name. So, for example:</p>

<pre>
java -jar microarray-0.0.2.jar rcheck my_scripts/script.R
</pre>

<h3>Adding R-scripts into Analyser</h3>

<p>When made publicly available, scripts should be added to scripts/R in the project directory (ProjectDirectoryStructure).</p>

<p>Scripts are configured (added to analyser) in a file called nami.properties on the analyser node. The file is created 
from default setting template data/nami_default.properties, so update it to make addition permanent. </p>
