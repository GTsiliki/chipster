<h2>Pathways / Hypergeometric test for KEGG or PFAM</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Searches for over- or under-represented genes for KEGG or PFAM categories.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>P value threshold (0-1) [0.05] </li>
<li>Search for over- or under-represented genes (under, over) [over]</li>
<li>Which ontology to test (KEGG, PFAM) [KEGG]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This tool takes the filtered data set, and goes through all KEGG or PFAM categories. 
For every category, a hypergeometric test is calculated, and the categories that acquire 
a p-value smaller than the user-specified threshold, are reported.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>Output is an HTML-file with a list of significant categories.
If you would like to know what are the genes listed as "observed", you can run the tool "Annotation/ Add annotations to data" on your original data set, followed by the tool "Preprocessing/ Filter using column term". 
	Please note that this can sometimes yield a higher number of rows than the gene number indicated in the hypergeomteric test result. 
	This is because there are several probes/probesets for one gene, and they are treated as one gene in the hypergeometric test.</p>
