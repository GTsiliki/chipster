<h2>Quality control / Illumina</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates some basic plots for cDNA quality control.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Image width [600]</li>
<li>Image height [600]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Three plots are created: boxplot, density plot and MA plot. Boxplot and density plot give
an idea about the distribution of the data, and MA plot can be used for assessing the possible
nonlinearity in the data caused by dye bias.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>Three images visualizing the plots mentioned above.</p>

<p>The arrays should be centered around the same number in the boxplot. Deviant arrays can be identified 
by the deviation from the common median value or by a spread that is greater than for other chips.</p>

<p>The density plot visualizes the spread of expression values. Each lines corresponds to the smoothed
histogram for one chip. Optimally, all lines should have a similar form, and have their peaks at the same
location. Usually this is not reached, and the chips that deviate from others can be identified by their
flatter line or a higher spread.</p>
