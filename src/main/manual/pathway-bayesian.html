<h2>Pathways / Bayesian network </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

Infers a Bayesian network from a timeseries data.

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>P-value threshold (0...1) [0.05]</li>
<li>Image width [600]
<li>Image height [600]
<li>Coloring scheme (solid, expression) [solid]
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

Only time series dataset where there is one replicate per time point can be analyzed. First,
partial correlation between genes are calculated, significance tests for the correlations are
calculated and only the genes that are significant at the selected p-value level are included
in the bayesian network that is inferred at the last phase of the analysis.

<h3>Output</h3>

A colored image visualizing the pathway.
