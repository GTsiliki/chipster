<h2>Filtering / Filter reads for adapters, length and Ns</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a FASTQ file, this tool filters reads based on whether they contain the given adapter sequence.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Adapter sequence that is used for filtering and that is subsequently removed (...) [CCTTAAGG]</li>
<li>Discard sequences shorter than (1-100) [15]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Adapters are clipped from the 3' end. If the read is too short after clipping, it is discarded. Also reads which contain unknown nucleotides (Ns) are discarded.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>A FASTQ file containing reads which contained the adapter sequence, which are long enough, and which don't contain Ns. 
In addition a log file is produced, telling how many reads the input file contained and what percentage of them were discarded. </p>

<h3>Reference</h3>

This tool is based on the FASTA/Q Clipper tool of the <a href="http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/">FASTX package</a>.
