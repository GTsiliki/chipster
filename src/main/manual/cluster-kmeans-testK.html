<h2>Clustering / K-means - estimate K </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This tool estimates the number of cluster to be used in the K-means clustering</p>

</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Image width (200-3200) [600]</li>
<li>Image height (200-3200) [600]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A K-means clustering is performed for every value of K between 1 and 100. When the
change in the within sum of squares of the clustering is less than 1% compared to the
previous number of K, the analysis is terminated.</p>

<p>The resulting image plots the K against the within sum of squares. A suitable number
of K can be estimated from this image. Search for the point, where the curve has a shoulder,
and pick the number of K from that region. For example, in the image below, a suitable
K could be somewhere between 7 and 13.</p>

<p>This clustering is done using Euclidean distance, and cannot be changed.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>A PNG image that can be visualized in the Chipster GUI.</p>
