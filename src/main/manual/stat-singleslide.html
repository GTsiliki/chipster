<h2>Statistics / Single slide methods</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These methods are applicable if only a single cDNA chip was used. </p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Lowess normalize (yes, no) [yes] </li>
<li>Analysis method (noise-envelope, Newton) [noise-envelope]</li>
<li>Significance cut-off (0...10) [2]
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data should be lowess-normalized before running this function. If the data has already been
normalized using some other means, it need not to be done again.</p>

<p>Noise-envelope finds the genes that are within significance cut-off (number of standard deviations) 
from the chip mean. Newton returns the genes that have the bayesian posterior probability higher 
than the significance cut-off (log odds of being differentially expressed).</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>A list of genes with expression value.</p>
