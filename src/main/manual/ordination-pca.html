<h2>Statistics / PCA</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates principal components for the selected gene list, and saves them for further use.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Data to use for the analysis (genes, chips) [genes] </li>
<li>Variability to explain (0...100) [80]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A principal component analysis is run for either genes or the samples. Principal components
are retained until the explained variability exceeds the specified value.</p>

<p>When PCA is run on samples, it's output can be visualized in Chipster GUI using the 3D scatterplot.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>A gene list with principal components (those are not expression values).</p>
