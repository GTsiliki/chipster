The filtering is calculated with PRINSEQ options <i>-max_len</i> and <i>-min_len</i>.<br> 
You should define the acceptable length range with parameters <b>Maximum length</b> and <b>Minimum length</b>.

The reads that pass the length filtering condition are saved to file called accepted.fastq or accepted.fasta.
You can also choose to store the reads that are filtered out to a separate file (rejected.fastq or rejected.fasta).
You can also print out a log file that contains information about the filtering task and
statistics about how many reads were accepted and rejected.
