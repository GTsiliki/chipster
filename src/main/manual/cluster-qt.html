<h2>Clustering / QT  </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In quality threshold (QT) clustering genes that fulfill some threshold criteria are put into the same cluster. 
This allows some control over how similar genes should actually be in order to be assigned to the same cluster.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Radius for similarity (0-1000) [20]</li>
<li>Image width (200-3200) [600]</li>
<li>Image height (200-3200) [600]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>QT clustering is performed using Euclidean distance, and cannot be changed. However, user can modify the distance 
setting threshold for grouping. If the distance between genes is lower than the specified threshold, they are put in 
the same cluster.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>A file giving cluster assignments for genes. It can be visualized using Chipster GUI. In addition, an
image of the clustering rendered in R is generated.</p>
