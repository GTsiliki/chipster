<h2>Filter reads for low complexity</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This tool filters reads based on low complexity using either the DUST or Entropy algorithm. 
The algorithm is selected by defining a threshold value for it. 
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The input data can be in FASTQ or FASTA format. You should give a threshold value 
to DUST or Entropy filter, but not both.
The method for which the threshold value is defined will be used.
</p><p>
The DUST method uses the threshold value as maximum allowed score.
The DUST approach is adapted from the algorithm used to mask low-complexity 
regions during BLAST search preprocessing. The scores are computed based on 
how often different trinucleotides occur and are scaled from 0 to 100. 
Higher scores imply lower complexity. A sequence of homopolymer repeats 
(e.g. TTTTTTTTT) has a score of 100, of dinucleotide repeats (e.g. TATATATATA) 
has a score around 49, and of trinucleotide repeats (e.g. TAGTAGTAGTAG) has a 
score around 32.
</p>
<p>
The Entropy method  uses the threshold as minimum allowed value.
The Entropy approach evaluates the entropy of trinucleotides in a sequence. 
The entropy values are scaled from 0 to 100 and lower entropy values imply 
lower complexity. A sequence of homopolymer repeats (e.g. TTTTTTTTT) has an 
entropy value of 0, of dinucleotide repeats (e.g. TATATATATA) has a value around 16, 
and of trinucleotide repeats (e.g. TAGTAGTAGTAG) has a value around 26.
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
The reads that pass the filtering condition are saved to file called accepted.fastq or accepted.fasta.
You can also choose to store the reads that are filtered out to a separate file (rejected.fastq or rejected.fasta).
You can also print out a log file that contains information about the filtering task and
statistics about how many reads were accepted and rejected.
