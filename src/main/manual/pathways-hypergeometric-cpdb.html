<h2>Pathways / Hypergeometric test for ConsensusPathDB</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Searches gene lists for over-represented pathways in the ConsensusPathDB (CPDB). 
This service is provided by the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>P value threshold (0-1) [0.05] </li>
<li>Input type (gene, uniprot) [gene] </li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This tool takes a filtered data set (e.g. a list of differentially expressed genes) and goes through all the pathways in CPDB. 
CPDB is a database that integrates pathway and other functional interaction resources like Reactome, HumanCyc, BioCarta, Pathway Interaction Database and others. 
For every pathway, a hypergeometric test is calculated, and the pathways that acquire 
a p-value smaller than the user-specified threshold are reported. 
This tool works with any data containing human gene symbols or UniProt identifiers. 
The background size used in the p-value calculation is the number of CPDB entities annotated with the same identifers (UniProt or human gene symbols).</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>Output is a list of significant pathways as text file (allows sorting by columns) and as an html file (with hyperlinks to the corresponding entries in the CPDB member databases).</p>
