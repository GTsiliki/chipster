<h2>Statistics / NMDS</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates a non-metric multidimensional scaling, and plots the chips to it.

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Image width (200-3200) [600]</li>
<li>Image height (200-3200) [600]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Non-metric multidimensional scaling is a method where a multidimensional data is displayed in
fewer dimensions. This tool first calculates euclidean distances between the samples in the dataset, 
and then visualizes these distances using a 2D-plot.</p> 

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>Two PNG images: one with Chipster internal names for the samples, and another one where the sample names are derived from the description column of the phenodata (these are editable by the user, by default they are the original file names). In both plots the sample names are colored according to the group column in the phenodata </p>
