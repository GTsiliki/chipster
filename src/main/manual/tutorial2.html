<p>We continue the analyses with the same data that was already analyzed in the <a href="tutorial1.html">Tutorial - part I</a>.</p>


<h3>Clustering</h3>

<p>Clustering is used for viewing the whole data set simultaneously. As we a list of differentially expressed genes,
clustering could also be used visualizing these differences. Select the statistical test result file (two-sample.tsv), and run the
hierarchical clustering tool:</p>

<img src="tt01.jpg">

<p>Hierarchical clustering might take a few minutes to complete, but once it does, double-click on the clustering
result (hc.txt) to visualize it:</p>

<img src="tt02.jpg">

<p>Clustering actually produces two files, but the other file is just a dummy. It contains real information only
if you choose to validate the clustering using bootstrapping. The dummy file (resample.png) looks like:</p>

<img src="tt03.jpg">

<p>Bootstrapping is a way to check to how well the data supports some clustering. To demonstrate this, and to check how 
the samples cluster, let's perform another hierarchical clustering, this time for samples. Use the same data set as above, 
but modify the settings: cluster genes, turn resampling on (bootstrapping), and change the number of replicates:</p>

<img src="tt04.jpg">

<p>Resampling is computer intensive, so the analysis might take a long time to run, if it is performed for a large
number of objects, e.g., genes.</p>

<p>Once the analysis is ready, you can visualize the result as a normal heatmap:</p>

<img src="tt05.jpg">

<p>The bootstrapping result is in the file resample.png, this time filled in with real data. The image is best
viewed maximized:</p>

<img src="tt06.jpg">

<p>The green numbers in the branches of the tree indicate the bootstrapping support as a percentage out of the number of
replicates. If the number is large, e.g., over 90, it indicates that the current branch of tree is well supported
by the data. For example, the right-most green number is 90. It means that in 9 out of ten replicates, the samples
microarray13 and microarray3 clustered together. As the support is high, it means that these samples should probably
be put together in the tree. Microarray12 and microarray4 were clustered together in 3 out of 10 replicates, and
that clustering is dubious, since the support value is low.</p>

<p>The red numbers can be interpreted as 1-p values. In other words, if the red number is high, it means that the
cluster is highly supported, and a hypothesis that the cluster does not exist can be rejected at 1-red number/100 level.

<h3>Gene set test</h3>

<p>Usually statistical testing is done gene-wise, i.e., the statistical significance is tested one gene at a time. 
Gene set test is a modification, where a group of genes is selected, and the significance of the group is tested
instead of individual genes. Grouping the genes together decreases the severity of multiple testing correction.</p>

<p>Gene set test can be performed for either KEGG pathways of GO ontology terms. The test has to be run on
the normalized, un-filtered data, so select the correct data before running the test. The test is available under 
Pathways category as a tool Gene set test:</p>

<img src="tt07.jpg">

<p>To run the test on KEGG pathways, modify the settings accordingly:</p>

<img src="tt08.jpg">

<p>The test returns an image (multtest.png) where the four most significant pathways are visualized (the number of
pathways can be changed):</p>

<img src="tt09.jpg">

<p>The bars in the plot show the influence of every gene on the test statistic. The statistic is the average of
the bars. The solid reference line shows the expected influence, if the gene was not associated with the group of
the samples. The marks on the bars are standard deviations, and the color of the bars indicated negative (red) or
positive (green) association with the grouping of the samples.</p>

<p>The most significant pathway is on the top-left corner of the image, and the pathways are plotted in the 
diminishing significance to the right and then down. The most significant pathways for this dataset were alanine
and aspartate metabolism, and cysteine metabolism.</p>

<p>A similar analysis can be performed for GO categories. The most significant GO term categories are associated
with ion transport:</p>

<img src="tt10.jpg">


<h3>Gene enrichment test</h3>

<p>Gene enrichment to certain categories, typically to KEGG pathways or GO ontology, can be tested using a 
hypergeometric test. In contrast to geneset test, gene enrichment is tested using a pre-filtered data set,
such as a one returned by statistical testing.</p>

<p>To run the test, select the data set that contains the statistically significantly differentially expressed
genes, and select tool Hypergeometric test under the tool category Pathways:</p>

<img src="tt11.jpg">

<p>Let's modify the parameters slightly, and run the test KEGG categories first:</p>

<img src="tt12.jpg">

<p>The results are saved in an HTML-file (hypergeo.html). When the file is visualized, it becomes apparent that
no significant results were found.</p>

<img src="tt13.jpg">

<p>Unfortunately, the same applies for GO categories for this dataset.</p>


<h3>Promoter analysis</h3>

<p>It is a distinct possibility that the genes that are differentially expressed are under a similar transcriptional
regulation. To look at this a bit closer, we can apply promoter analysis tools for the data set that contains
the differentially expressed genes.</p>

<p>Let's first see, if the genes contain some clusters of known transcription factor binding sites. The tool for
this analysis is located under the category Promoter analysis with name ClusterBuster:</p>

<img src="tt14.jpg">

<p>By default, it is run for human promoters using short promoter sequences (1000 bps):</p>

<img src="tt15.jpg">

<p>To get an idea of other options, you can click on the button More help, and you'll be directed to the tool 
specific help page:</p>

<img src="tt16.jpg">

<p>We will run the tool with the default options. The analysis might take a long time, since there were 96 genes 
to go through. Therefore, we will start another analysis at the same time. Select the Weeder tool under the category Promoter analysis:</p>

<img src="tt17.jpg">

<p>By default it is run for human genes, and is thus directly suitable for the current dataset:</p>

<img src="tt18.jpg">

<p>Once you've started the Weeder analyses, you'll see that the job status bar on the bottom of the screen will
show a text "2 jobs running":</p>

<img src="tt19.jpg">

<p>You can get a list of running jobs by clicking the arrow up icon next to the job status bar:</p>

<img src="tt20.jpg">

<p>A sometimes handy option is to cancel a certain job by clicking it in the job list. The cancelled job
then vanishes from the job list:</p>

<img src="tt21.jpg">

<p>Once the ClusterBuster job is ready, a new file will be generated (clusters.txt). The file lists the significant
transcription factor binding sites for each of the promoter sequences submitted for the analysis. In addition,
the location of the binding sites is marked on the sequence:</p>

<img src="tt22.jpg">

<p>The Weeder job will take much longer than the ClusterBuster job to finish, but once it does, a new file called
seqs.html is generated. It contains the results for the search of common motifs from the promoter sequences. The part
under header MY ADVICE will list the interesting findings for all promoter sequences:</p>

<h3>Submitting data to public databases</h3>

<p>This section can be skipped in this tutorial, since the data used here should not be resubmitted to
the database as it already is there.</p>

<p>If you've ambitions of publishing your dataset in some good peer-reviewed journal, the data needs to be
submitted to public databases. The principal ones are GEO at NCBI and ArrayExpress at EBI. Chipster
contains two accessory functions to help you submit the data. The scripts Export GEO's SOFT format (for
GEO database) and Export tab2mage format (for ArrayExpress database) are located under the tool category 
Utilities:</p>

<img src="tt24.jpg">

<p>The scripts should be run on the normalized data. Both tools write out a text file that you need to fill 
in yourself, but the format is correct for batch submission to the mentioned databases. For example, Export
to GEO's SOFT format generates a files soft.txt that needs to be exported:</p>

<img src="tt25.jpg">

<p>The exported file can then be opened and edited in some word processor:</p>

<img src="tt26.jpg">

<p>There is short description for every file, and for the whole dataset in the end of the file, 
and all lines beginning with ! should be filled in by the user. This file can be used in a batch submission
to GEO database through a www-interface.</p>


<h3>Documenting the work done</h3>

<p>It is very easy to become confused of how some analysis was carried out in the first place. To help you out
figuring this even after a longer session, Chipster keeps track of the analysis you've done. Select the data set
containing the differentially expressed genes, and right-click on it. From the opening menu, select View history
as text:</p>

<img src="tt27.jpg">

<p>The opening History displays some relevant information regarding how the result was reached:</p>

<img src="tt28.jpg">

<p>The history lists all the analysis steps, the tools used for them, and what parameters the tools were run with.
You select what is displayed in the history by ticking the boxes above the text field.
For example, you can add the complete R source code to the history if you like. You can save the history to disk
by clicking on the Save-button. It is probably a good idea to save the history with the exported data files, if
you're later on going use them for further analyses.</p>
