<h2>Poly-A/T trimmer</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This tool removes poly-A/T tails from nucleotide sequences. The input data can be in FASTQ or in FASTA format.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p> Poly-A/T tails can be trimmed from either end specifying a minimum tail length. 
All repeats of As or Ts with at least this length will be trimmed from the read ends. 
A small number of tails can occur even after trimming poly-A/T tails. For example, 
a read that ends with AAAAATTTTT and that has been trimmed for the poly-T will still contain the poly-A.
</p>
<p>
Trimming poly-A/T tails can reduce the number of false positives during database searches, 
as long tails tend to align well to sequences with low complexity or sequences with 
poly-A tails in the database.
<p><p>
This tool utilizes the <a href="http://prinseq.sourceforge.net/">PRINSEQ package</a>. 
The trimming is calculated with PRINSEQ options <i>-trim_tail_left</i> and <i>-trim_tail_right</i>.
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
The trimmed reads are saved to file called trimmed.fastq or trimmed.fasta.
You can also request a log file that contains information about the filtering task and
statistics about how many reads were rejected.
</p>
	

<h3>Reference</h3>

This tool is based on the <a href="http://prinseq.sourceforge.net/">PRINSEQ package</a>.
