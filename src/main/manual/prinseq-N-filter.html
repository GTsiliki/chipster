<h2>Filter reads for Ns</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Filters reads based the number or percentage of unassigned nucleotides (Ns).
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This tool utilizes the <a href="http://prinseq.sourceforge.net/">PRINSEQ package</a>.<br> 
The filtering is calculated with PRINSEQ options <i>-ns_max_n</i> and <i>-ns_max_p</i>.

<li>If you define the "Maximum count of Ns" value, the reads that contain more the defined amount of Ns are filtered out.</li>
<li>If you define the "Maximum Percentage of Ns" value, the reads that contain higher percentage of Ns are filtered out.</li>
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
The reads that pass the filtering condition are saved to file called accepted.fastq or accepted.fasta.
You can also choose to store the reads that are filtered out to a separate file (rejected.fastq or rejected.fasta).
You can also print out a log file that contains information about the filtering task and
statistics about how many reads were accepted and rejected.
