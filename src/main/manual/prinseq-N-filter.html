<h2>Filter based on Ns</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Filters out reads form a reads file based the number or percentage of unassigned nucleotides in a read.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This tool utilizes the <a href="http://prinseq.sourceforge.net/">PRINSEQ package</a>.<br> 
The filtering is calculated with PRIONSEQ options <i>-ns_max_n</i> and <i>-ns_max_p</i>.

<li>If you define the "Maximum count of Ns" value, the reads that contain more the defined amount of reads are filtered out.</li>
<li>If you define the "Maximum Percentage of Ns" value, the reads that contain higher percentage of Ns are filtered out.</li>
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
The reads that pass the filtering condition are saved to file called <b>accepted.fastq</b> or <a>accepted.fasta</a>.
You can also choose to write out the duplicate reads that are filtered out.
These reads are stored to file <b>rejected.fastq</b> or <b>rejected.fasta</b>.
You can also print out a log file that contains information about the filtering task and
statistics about how many reads were accepted and rejected.
