<h2>Pathways / Associations to Reactome pathways</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Maps genes to pathways in the Reactome database. This service is provided by the EBI.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Input type (affyid, uniprot) [affyid] </li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This tool takes a filtered data set (e.g. a list of differentially expressed genes) and maps the genes to Reactome pathways. It works only with Affymetrix and UniProt identifiers.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>Output is a list of pathways as a text file (allows sorting by columns) and as an html file (with hyperlinks to the corresponding entries in the Reactome database).</p>

<h3>References</h3>
