<h2>Preprocessing / Remove missing values</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Removes all genes that have at least one missing value in the experiment.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>None</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>All genes that contain at least one missing value are excluded from the data.
This tool is suggested to be used after cDNA/Agilent normalization, since these
might generate missing values that need to be processed before, e.g., clustering
or statistical tests. A good preprocessing order might be to first impute these
missing values, and after that remove all the remaining missing values using this
tool.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>A tab-delimited text-file containing the cut-down dataset.</p>
