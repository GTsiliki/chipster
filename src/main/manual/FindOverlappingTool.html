<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Given two BED files, this tool returns those regions which overlap with some region in the other input file. Also known as intersection.
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Type of regions returned (Original regions from file A, Original regions from file A augmented with info from file B, Original regions from both files, Regions from both files merged, Overlapping parts of the regions) [Original regions from file A]</li>
<li>Minimum number of overlapping bases (1-1000000000) [1]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
Note that if two A regions match one B region and you ask for "Original regions from both files", the B region will appear twice in the result list.
</p>


<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
