GSM11805.CEL	kidney	1	70	1	total RNA	biotin	Homo sapiens	case-control	GPL96	Renal cell carcinoma is a common malignancy that often presents as a metastatic-disease for which there are no effective treatments. To gain insights into the mechanism of renal cell carcinogenesis, a number of genome-wide expression profiling studies have been performed. Surprisingly, there is very poor agreement among these studies as to which genes are differentially regulated. To better understand this lack of agreement we profiled renal cell tumor gene expression using genome-wide microarrays (45,000 probe sets) and compare our analysis to previous microarray studies.	Each total RNA sample is hybridized to an Affymetrix HGU133A chip. For most of the renal clear cell carcinoma samples there is a corresponding adjacent normal tissue sample from the same patient.	Trizol extraction of total RNA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 microg total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).	Following fragmentation, 10 microg of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip Array. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.
