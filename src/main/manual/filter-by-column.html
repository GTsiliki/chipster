<h2>Utilities / Filter by column </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Filter genes on the basis of information in one of the data columns.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>column (...) [empty]</li>
<li>type (continuous, discrete) [continuous]]</li>
<li>discrete match (...)[empty]</li>
<li>cutoff (-100000...100000) [1]</li>
<li>smaller, larger, or equal to the cutoff (smaller-than, larger-than, equal-to, within, outside) [smaller-than]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Filters genes based on values in the selected data column. You can filter for discrete matches such as GO terms (after using the tool "Add annotations to data" tool) or for continuous values (for example after using the tool "Calculate descriptive statistics"). When filtering for discrete matches you have to set the type parameter to "discrete", enter the filtering term to the "discrete match" field, and set the last parameter to equal-to.
When filtering continuous values the options "within" and "outside" can be used to filter based on a symmetrical range of values, applicable for instance when filtering for "at least 2-fold up- and down-regulated genes". </p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>A tabular text file containing only the genes that pass the filter.</p>
