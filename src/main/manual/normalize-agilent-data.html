<h2>Normalizing Agilent data</h2>

<p>Select the files you want to normalize. In order to normalize all chips in the same dataset together, 
you need to select them all (double-click on the folder). Then select Normalization / Agilent from the 
Analysis tools:</p>

<p>Normalization parameters can be modified by clicking the Edit parameters -button. For Agilent data, user can select
background correction method, chip-wise normalization and gene-wise normalization methods. In addition, user must 
select the chiptype:</p>

<p>Background intensities are usually subtracted from the spot (foreground) intensities, but user can turn this
option off. In addition to simple subtraction, Edwards method can be used. Sometimes simple background subtraction
produces negative corrected values. This can be avoided using Edwards method for background correction.</p>

<p>Chips (arrays) can be normalized using median translation of lowess method. Chips can also be left unnormalized,
if they have been normalized earlier.</p>

<p>Genes can be left unnormalized, which is the default option, since to make chips comparable, it is enough to
normalize just the chips. Genes can be normalized by scaling (subtract the mean and divide by standard deviation) or
by quantile method. Gene-wise normalization will affect the results of most statistical procedures and plotting
functions.</p>

<p>After modifying the setting, click the Run-button to run the normalization. A blue bar starts moving in
the lower-right corner. That indicates that a job is being run. </p>

<p>Normalization can take a rather long time (several minutes) depending on the type of normalization you have
chosen. After the job is done, a new file (normalized.txt) should appear under the current folder in the Datasets.</p>

<p>Note that in the Workflow view the normalized data is coupled with phenodata. The next step would be to fill in
the phenodata table, at least the group column, and describe the experimental design for the system. Group could be
anything interesting. For example, if one is comparing cancer patients to their healthy controls, the controls would be
the group number one and the cancer patients group number two.</p>

<p>Click on the phenodata in the Workflow view to select it. Go to Data visualization, and select phenodata editor from 
the pull down menu. </p>

<p>Fill in the column called group according to the experimental variable you would like to test in the further analysis. 
You can rearrange the phenodata rows according to the original name by clicking on the column header. Every row represents
one chip, and the group column should be filled for every chip. No empty cells or strings are allowed. You should type
one number in every cell.</p>

<p>Once the group column in the phenodata has been filled, the small exclamation mark beside the phenodata in the Workflow
view disappears to signal that you are ready to analyse the dataset.</p>

<p>Further analysis, such as filtering, statistical testing, clustering, etc. can now be performed using
this normalized dataset.</p>
