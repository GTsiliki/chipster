<h2>Statistics / Correlate with phenodata</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Finds genes that have a high correlation with the selected phenodata variable.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Correlation threshold (0-1) [0.95]</li>
<li>Correlation method (pearson, spearman) [pearson]</li>
<li>Phenodata column</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This tools goes through all the genes in the data, calculates their correlation
coefficients against the selected phenodata variable, and saves those that exceed
the selected correlation threshold.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>A list of genes that have a correlation coefficient higher or equal to the
one selected.</p>
