<h2>Adjust P-values</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This tool adjusts the raw p-values for multiple tests</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>column (...) [EMPTY] </li>
<li>p-value adjustment method (Bonferroni, Holm, Hochberg, BH, BY) [BH]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This tool takes the raw p-values generated by some statistical testing
tool, and adjusts them for multiple comparisons. This is especially meant
to work with tests based on empirical Bayes (limma) method when one
also wants to filter the gene set using some unspecific filter. In that
case, first run the empirical bayes test, then filter using some filtering
tool, and last, adjust the p-values using this tool.</p>

<p>Multiple testing correction options are Bonferroni, Holm, and Hochberg for family-wise error rate (FWER) and Benjamini-Hochberg and Benjamini-Yakutieri for false discovery rate (FDR). Of these Bonferroni is the most conservative, returning the smallest number of significant results, and FDR-based adjustments are less conservative, and return more significant results.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>A new dataset with adjusted p-values.</p>
