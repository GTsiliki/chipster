<h2>Process prenormalized affy</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>If you bring in Affymetrix data which has been normalized by some other software, this tool converts the data to Chipster format (by adding the text "chip." in front of the expression value columns, 
adds annotation information (if the chiptype is specified) and generates the phenodata file.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Chiptype (empty) [empty] </li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The normalized data file needs to be imported to Chipster using the Import tool. Every column containing normalized expression values need to be specified as Sample in the Import tool and the Affymetrix probe ID as Identifier.
It is possible to use other types of identifier as well, like gene symbol Entrez ID or similar, but no additional annotation information will be added in this step.</p>
<p> If you want to be able to use analysis tools requiring annotation information, you need to specify the chiptype using the chip's annotation package name (they are listed in brackets after the chip name <a href="http://chipster.csc.fi/manual/supported-chips.html">here</a>)</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>A new normalized dataset and a phenodata file.</p>
