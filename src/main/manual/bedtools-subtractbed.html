<h2>BEDTools subtrackBed</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Removes the portion(s) of an interval that is overlapped by another feature(s).
</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Minimum overlap required as a fraction of A (0.0-0.1) [0.000000001]</li> 
<li>Force strandedness (yes, no) [no]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
subtractBed searches for features in B that overlap A. If an overlapping feature is found in B, the
overlapping portion is removed from A and the remaining portion of A is reported. If a feature in B
overlaps all of a feature in A, the A feature will not be reported.
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
The output is a BED file.
