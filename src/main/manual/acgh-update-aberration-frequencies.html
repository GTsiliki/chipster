	<h2>aCGH tools / Calculate aberration frequencies for called copy number data</h2>
	
	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>Calculates frequencies of losses, gains and amplifications for called aCGH data. They are automatically calculated by the Call copy number aberrations from aCGH data tool, so normally there is no need to run this tool separately. But if you use e.g. the Extract samples from dataset tool, the frequencies should be updated using this script.</p>
	
	<h3>Parameters</h3>
	<p>None</p>
	
	<h3>Details</h3>
	<p>None</p>
	
	<h3>Output</h3>
	<p>The original input table with updated loss.freq and gain.freq columns for the frequencies of losses and gains, respectively. If the input data contains amplifications, amp.freq column is also included.</p>
	
	<h3>References</h3>
	<p>None</p>
