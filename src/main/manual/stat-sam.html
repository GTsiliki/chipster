<h2>Statistics / SAM</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

Test every gene's expression for a difference between two groups.

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Multiple testing correction method (none, Bonferroni, BH) [BH]</li>
<li>P-value cut-off (0...1) [0.05]</li>
<li>Random number (0...1000) [1]</li>
<li>Number of delta values (1...100) [10]</li>
<li>Delta value to plot (0.1...100) [1]</li> 
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>To get the optimal results from this tool it requires two separate runs. First run the
tool with default settings. Then consult the generated false discovery rate graph, and adjust the
delta value used for plotting (it is also used for generating the list of significant genes) accordingly. 
</p>

<p>The random number selection is essential. If you would like to run the test several times, you might want
to adjust the random number, since using the same random number should always give you exactly the same result.
This also assists in reporting the results: mention the used the random number in the report, and somebody
else could replicate your results.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>Two images plotting the genes with delta limits on one graph and the delta values against the
false discovery rate on the other. In addition, a data file containing the significant genes and 
their fold changes and p-values is generated.</p>
