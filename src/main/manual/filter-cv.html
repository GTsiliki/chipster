<h2>Filter / Coefficient of variation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Filter genes on the basis of their coefficient of variation (standard deviation / mean).

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>None</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Calculates a coefficient of variation (CV) for every gene, and returns the genes
where CV is bigger than the median of all calculated
CVs. In other words, the genes that have more similar
values for all observations are are filtered away.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>A tabular text file containing only the genes that pass the filter.</p>
