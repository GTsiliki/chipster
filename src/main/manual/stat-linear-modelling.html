<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This tool integrates linear modelling to Chipster as implemented in the limma package. 
In order to use this tool, you need to define your experimental setup in the phenodata file
by adding new columns to the table. Experimental factors are then described in these columns using numbers. For example
in a study where you would like to compare expression in both males and females and cancerous and
non-cancerous tissue, two columns in the phenodata are needed: gender and group.</p>

<p>You can have a maximum of three factors (parameters main.effect1...main.effect3). The parameter technical replication allows you to specify which samples are technical replicates (the same RNA hybridized on different chips), and it is treated in a special way in the linear models (using a
mixed model). The parameter pairing allows you to describe which samples are paired (for example derived from the same individual), and it's also
treated in a special way.</p>

<p>Factors can either be treated as continuous (e.g., time) or non-continuous (e.g., cell-type). If the
factor is treated as continuous (linear), it is also inputted into the model as a continuous variable. If the
factor needs to be treated as non-continuous (non-linear), this needs to be specified by changing the corresponding parameter treat.main.effect1.as.factor...treat.main.effect3.as.factor to "yes". When treated as a factor, dummy contrasts for comparing all possible
factor levels to the first one are automatically constructed.</p>

<p>It is possible to have interactions of the factors in the model, and it is possible to define
which kind of interactions need to be reported. The model can contain either the main effects of the
factors only (no interactions), or all two-way or three-way interactions. Interactions are put into the model
considering their marginality, so main effects are always included in the models that contain interactions.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>Four tab-delimited text files are output as a result of the analysis. The "limma-design.tsv" table contains the design matrix for the linear model as required by the limma package, and can be used to make sure that the analysis was setup appropriately.
The "p.values.tsv" table lists the p-values for all contrasts for each of the main effects, the number and factor level being reflected in the column headers. For example, a column labeled "chip.p.adjusted.main13.tsv" refers to the comparison of level 3 to level 1 (the reference level) for the first of the main effects.
The "foldchange.tsv" table holds the corresponding fold changes. When an effect has been setup to be treated as "factor" the fold change value is essentially the log2 of the ratio between the averaged expression values of samples for a particular factor level and the first (reference) factor level.
In the case the effect is treated as "linear", the fold change values are actually an estimate of the slope of the linear regression fitted to the data. The "limma.tsv" table combines the p-values and fold changes results, together with the expression values and annotation information for the probes tested, in a
convenient summary table that is suitable for further processing or analysis.</p>
