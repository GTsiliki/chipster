<h2>NGS ChIP-seq /  Find the nearest genes for regions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

This tool takes set of genomic regions, such as ChIP-seq peaks, and fetches the nearest gene for each.

<br>
<br>
<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Species (Human, Mouse, Rat) [Human]</li>
</ul>

<br>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For each of the genomic regions in the input data file, the closest located gene will be reported, without regards to distance, 3' or 5' location or strand specificity. Such information is given in the result file, allowing further filtering for any of these criteria. If two genes are located at exactly the same distance from a query region the gene that is reported will be selected randomly from the pair.</p>


<br>
<h3>Output</h3>

<p>The analysis output consists of the following:</p>


<ul>
<li>nearest-genes.tsv:	A table containing all the genomic regions with its closest located gene, including information to characterize the gene location with regards to the query region.<br></li>
<br>
<li>unique-genes-list.tsv:	A table containing gene specific information, condensed to unique gene occurrencies.<br></li>
</ul>

<br>
