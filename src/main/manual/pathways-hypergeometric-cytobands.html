<h2>Pathways / Hypergeometric test for cytobands</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Finds chromosomal locations, i.e., cytobands for which the genes in the selected dataset are either over- or under-represented.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>P value threshold (0-1) [0.05] </li>
<li>Search for over- or under-represented genes (under, over) [over]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p> 
This tool takes a filtered data set and goes through all cytobands. In order to avoid the identification of directly related
regions with considerable overlap of genes, this tool uses a method which conditions on all subregions that are themselves significant at a specified p-
value cutoff. First the subregions are tested and the genes of the significant subregions are removed before testing the larger regions.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>Output is an HTML-file with a list of significant cytobands.</p>
