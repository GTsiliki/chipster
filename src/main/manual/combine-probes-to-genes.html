<h2>Combine probes to genes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This tool takes a normalized dataset, and combines all probes that have been mapped to the same
gene name into a single expression estimate for that gene. Probes are averaged together to get a 
single estimate of expression.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Produce identifiers (no, yes) [no]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>By default, gene names are used as identifiers after combination. This can be changed by adjusting the
parameter to the setting 'yes'. Using this setting, every gene is identified by one of the original
identifiers. After that, all normal analyses requiring annotation information can be used (not so with gene names).</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>A new, smaller dataset
