Feature API is an interface for accessing DataBean content from a higher level. It allows implementation
of pluggable accessors (features) and modifiers that hide implementation details and domain specific issues.
The aim of the Feature API design is to allow flexible high level access while still providing good 
(close to optimal) performance and scalability.
